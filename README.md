# IGA-Unity-TA-Test

This is a simple Unity Project intended to test a Unity TA candidate's ability to help students solve problems in their projects. It is meant to simulate a state a student who is struggling might wind up in. 

You should be able to debug this project in less than an hour, and then write up a brief, 2-3 paragraph explanation of what you fixed. This explanation should be written as if you were writing it for a student to explain what went wrong, how to fix it, and any additional background information that might help them grow. 

The game is Pachinko. 

- Players should be able to move a launcher along the top of the screen via moving their mouse.
- Players should be able to launch balls by clicking on the screen. 
- Players should receive points when a ball hits a star.
- Some platforms should be bouncy. Some shoule be destructible.
- A player should be able to hit all stars on any given level.

There are 5 problems that were deliberately added to the game.

Upon debugging them and writing up your 2-3 paragrpah explanation, please send it to Willem with an approximate time of how long it took you.
